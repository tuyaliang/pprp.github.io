## deep learning

Deep learning techniques have emerged in recent years as powerful methods for learning feature representations directly from data, and have led to remarkable breakthroughs in 
the field of generic object detection.


generic object detection research: leading detection frameworks and fundamental subproblems including:
- object feature representation
- object proposal generation
- context information modeling
- training strategies

Object detection has a wide range of applications in many areas of artificial intelligence and information technologies, including robot vision, consumer electronics, security, autonomous driving, human computer interaction, content based image retrieval, intelligent video surveillance, and augmented reality.
